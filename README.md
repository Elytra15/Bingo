# Bingo
A simple bingo website with great functionality 


Elytra15 Bingo website is a 300-row long html code made to be able to enter text in 25 text fields then change to "Mark" mode and mark the tiles you want. For example i use the website for "Apple Bingo". Before a Apple event i enter what i think will be released and then during the event i mark what i got right. The text is saved even if you close the page or refresh. To test the website visit https://bingo.elytra15.com .

The code is free to use or modify, you can use it on your own website or for private use. The only thing i request is that you keep the "Github" button so other people can download and use the code.

If you have any request, bugs or questions don't hesitate to contact me support@elytra15.com
